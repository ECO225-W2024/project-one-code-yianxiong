Dear instructor/TA who is grading my work,

The reason why my work looks like commits within minutes is because of I made a huge mistake of downloading each version instead of keep working within one file. 
And I just realize my mistake this afternoon, I deleted all of my commits and redo all of my versions within one file, and this process takes a very short time as you can see.

Thank you for your understanding!!!
